In an inventive take on a digital face filter, I sought to bring a mask into a non-electrified and tactile reality. As it was difficult for me to engage with technology as a result of a concussion at the time of this project. I found a path where I was able to create a mask informed by technology as well as ideas of anti-surveillance in the context of critical opacity.

<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include video.html path="assets/video/MaskDemo.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
</div>
 
This piece is inspired by themes from Haraway’s “A Cyborg Manifesto” and Blas and Gaboury's "Biometrics and Opacity: A Conversation". The mask exists in a space informed by anti-surveillance and the integration of machine and biology. The combination of these factors helps create the obscurity and vibrant individuality of the mask in its final form. 

Materials Utilized:
