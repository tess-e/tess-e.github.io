   This project explores the use of a generative adversarial network (GAN) on Snapchat memories. There is an exploration of the lack of coherent output images produced. Input data to GANS needs to be formatted in very specific ways such as a very cohesive dataset of an item such as an animal, especially at the low-level code I was using. Along with this, my personal computing power did not allow for high-resolution images and large datasets due to runtime, highlighting the limitations of personal technology. This piece explores the outputs of the GAN in the context of the creation of meaning and the experience of understanding data that does not make intuitive sense to the human mind.
