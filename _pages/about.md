I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago exploring the intersection of cyber security and media studies. I am co-advised by an interdisciplinary team including [Marc Downie](https://cms.uchicago.edu/people/marc-downie), [Allison McDonald](https://amcdon.com/), and [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/).

**I seek to engage in interdisciplinary research bridging the gap between media theory and formal technical practices. I am particularly interested in conceptualizations of anonymity, open access, and grappling with the implications of increasing integration of media based technologies in daily life.**

My research spans
I have a strong background in machine learning and security and have completed both artistic and technical works based on these foundations. As an artist, I utilize new media technologies as avenues to communicate computing topics to non-technical audiences. In my academic work I pull from media theory as a unique avenue for solidly framing the mass media of computing in a human centered manner. I look at the long history and theorization of art, radio, television, and film for possible solutions to modern analogs of these dilemmas.

In April 2023 I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor with bachelor's degrees in **Data Science Engineering** Summa Cum Laude and **Film, Television, and Media** with Distinction.
