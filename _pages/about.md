I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago exploring the intersection of cyber security and media studies. I am co-advised by an interdisciplinary team including [Marc Downie](https://cms.uchicago.edu/people/marc-downie),  [Blase Ur](https://www.blaseur.com/), and [Allison McDonald](https://amcdon.com/).

My research explores communication of privacy and security with and between end-users. My research explores novel mechanisms (e.g., art, AI agents) for communicating security and privacy topics. I am also interested in how security and privacy topics are communicated within specific communities (e.g., content creators). My work pulls from the theorization of art, radio, television, and film to highlight modern analogues in the mass media of computing.
As an artist, I utilize new media technologies as avenues to communicate computing topics to non-technical audiences.

In April 2023 I graduated from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor with bachelor's degrees in **Data Science Engineering** Summa Cum Laude and **Film, Television, and Media** with Distinction.
