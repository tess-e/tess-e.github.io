I led on a qualitative interview study exploring educational content creation on YouTube.

Previously, I worked on was an "Everyday Resistance" project with a graduate student and an interdisciplinary team. This project focused on users' experience with social media addiction under surveillance capitalism. Through this project, I worked on literature review, gaining approval for human and animal subject studies, and explorations of technical interventions. I worked on coding the interaction between a router and the wearable on the dog collar. Python was utilized with threading and sockets to modulate social media access on the router based on time spent with the pet.
